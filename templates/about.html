I'VE BEEN DESIGNING WEBSITES FOR OVER THREE YEARS.</h5></div><div class="outer-container"><div class="inner-container"><p> <span class="dropcap">H</span>ello, I am Bony Roopchandani. I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science. I love to code, especially in <em><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> (emphasized)</em>, just give me a reason. Web designing interests me. If you think I can help you with your project or some creative need, <a href="mailto:hello@bonyroopchandani.com">contact me</a>.</p><p>I am obsessed with learning new things and even more obsessed with creating such things. I was always facinated by computers and since when I was in my elementary, I knew I would end up in a career working with them.</p></div><div class="inner-container"><p> My journey begins with the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C Programming Language</a>. Since I was having no prior programming experience, it took me a year to learn it. With that I started participating in programming contests and loved solving algorithmic problems since then. I taught myself <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> which has a powerful <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library">Standard Template Library</a>, which helped me in solving the problems quickly. The rest as they say is history. Programming according to me is not about "what you know or how much you know". Its about "how you think and think a better version of it". And that's endless.</p></div><div class="next-inner-container"><p>When I am not Programming, I love to hang around with my family or listen to some of the most creative songs or watch sports. I've also created my personal <a href="http://blog.bonyroopchandani.com">BLOG</a> where I share some of my programming experiences and various other related discussions. Do checkout <a href="/projects" trigger-ajax>my work</a> to know more about what I know and the things I've built.</p></div></div>{% endblock %}
